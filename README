SETUP

If the installer includes a `trunk` kernel:
  Boot into the other one
  Purge the package, e.g.: dpkg -P linux-image-2.6.32-trunk-686

`slapd` requires adjustments to the config file:
  Readable by group `openldap`, not readable by others
  Credentials for replication

Quotas need to be enabled by running:
  shutdown now
  umount and then mount /srv/home
  quotacheck -c -a -v

Sun Rays, fatlab netbooting, and Eclipse are set up with scripts in /root
